# Tips for using dep:
# * Run dep ensure to sync your Gopkg.lock and vendor directory with your Gopkg.toml and code.
# * Gopkg.toml tells dep:
#   * How to upgrade your dependencies.
#   * How to resolve differences between the various versions that you vs. your dependencies require.
#   * What versions downstream consumers of your code as a library should use.
# * You don't have to add every dependency that you use to Gopkg.toml, dep knows
#   your dependencies from the imports in your code, and uses the lock to stick to a particular revision.
# * In case of merge conflicts, focus on fixing Gopkg.toml, and then re-run dep ensure to update Gopkg.lock.
# * Isolate changes to the vendor/ directory in a separate commit so it's easier to review your pull request.


# Force dep to vendor the code generators, which aren't imported just used at dev time.
# Picking a subpackage with Go code won't be necessary once https://github.com/golang/dep/pull/1545 is merged.
